## Summary

As a UCI student who has to add/drop classes every quarter, UCI’s online enrollment system WebReg has worried me more than once about whether or 
not I have actually succeeded in adding and dropping classes. Additionally, I remember as a new UCI student, I had trouble understanding what 
certain buttons and fields were for, and what menus I needed to use to accomplish my tasks. I performed user research and redesigned WebReg to 
better fit user’s needs and expectations.
